    (115,'Recommended','Very fun, improved from launch, enjoyed every moment'),
    (115,'Not Recommended','Why is the main story so short?'),

    (116,'Recommended','My only regret for NMS is that I let it sit in my wish-list for so long. I finally grabbed it after Thanksgiving on sale and haven''t been able to put it down since.'),
    (116,'Not Recommended','boring.'),
    (116,'Recommended','i love it so much'),
    (116,'Not Recommended','This is the worst space combat I''ve ever played. I don''t know how they managed to make it this not fun to play. Otherwise I kind of enjoy the game, but trying to do the combat based content is absolutely terrible'),

    (117,'Recommended','Midnight Suns is the ideal game for anyone who enjoys card games of just about any sort. '),
    (117,'Not Recommended','Honestly I love this game but whatever they did in the last update made it completely unplayable.'),
    (117,'Recommended','Great game, perfect even for those inexperienced with the tactical/strategy genres.'),

    (118,'Recommended','Phenomenal masterpiece of a story.'),
    (118,'Not Recommended','Very good game! I enjoyed it very much but its not worth 40$ for me. I got when it was on discount and i''d say its a pretty good deal. I highly recommand to buy it when its on sale.'),
    (118,'Recommended','Just a great game..please do not look at spoilers, because story is so goood'),
    (118,'Not Recommended','6/10'),

    (119,'Recommended','Even though i''m crazy about GTA series, i''d say Mafia 2 easily beats all the GTAs in single player'),
    (119,'Not Recommended','I''ve played this game for 7 years and never had a single problem but now a remastered version gets released and out of nowhere my game doesn''t even launch anymore'),
    (119,'Recommended','best game from my childhood'),

    (120,'Recommended','Well, the game is actually really good. Though it was a very long game, it remained consistent'),
    (120,'Not Recommended','Actually kinda decent game but awful port.'),
    (120,'Recommended','Bad pc port, but I get to be friend with Vito and hear the gamer word here and there so overall a good 6/10'),
    (120,'Not Recommended','> '"supports Mac OS"'does not'),

    (121,'Recommended','first bioshock game i ever played. I really enjoyed it.'),
    (121,'Recommended','good'),
    (121,'Not Recommended','This is an ok game for me, I think the previous 2 games is still better. I don''t know why they made the decision of only equipping you only 2 weapons where as in previous you can equip all of them.'),

    (122,'Recommended','Not talking about the game itself, which is amazing, but the Remastered versions of Bioshock 1 and 2 haven''t crashed at all throughout my over 25 hours combined in each game.'),
    (122,'Not Recommended','A "quality of life" update made the game unstable and prone to crashing at least for the remaster. Wouldn''t bother buying at this point in time but if you do play the original.'),
    (122,'Recommended','Great Game...blast from past...'),
    (122,'Not Recommended','It''s riddled with bugs and consistently crashes during the Alex The Great sections, to the point I can''t progress.'),

    (124,'Not Recommended','I didn''t love the storie'),
    (124,'Recommended','Easily the most underrated borderlands games. Excellent movement, incredibly interesting story line.'),

    (128,'Not Recommended','hasnt worked for a long while, if i have to change game files to make it work it shouldnt be on the steam store'),
    (128,'Recommended','i think that it was a good game, i has many features which are good fun but it takes a long time to learn how to play'),
    (128,'Not Recommended','Bland, boring, uninspired, even the screen shots for the game look blurry and unappealing. This is not the Alpha Centauri remake you are looking for.'),

    (129,'Recommended','Loving this game, would highly recommend picking up this critically acclaimed title.'),
    (129,'Not Recommended','Very fun, except for when you try to play multiplayer and players randomly stop being able to move units, which persists even after reloading the save and trying everything in your power to fix it.'),
    (129,'Recommended','★★★★'),
    (129,'Not Recommended','Love the game, however there is a longstanding and known bug (on Mac) that causes the game to crash to desktop on same turn in each game'),

    (130,'Recommended','plenty of interesting expansion and variety of levels and maps'),
    (130,'Not Recommended','Not worth $20, maybe worth $5 at most, definitely $2 if it goes on sale'),
    (130,'Recommended','This game has kept my interest for years. It improves on the original in graphics and game play. The open mod system has allowed for numerous improvements to the base game'),
    (130,'Not Recommended','Broken.. and it''s such a shame.'),

    (131,'Recommended','Still the best Civ game'),
    (131,'Not Recommended','I paid for this bro! Now i have to download pirate version to play with my friends because this multi crap doesn´t work. I´m now totally unprotected with open ports and direct IP-s.'),
    (131,'Recommended','Endless, endless hours of addictive gameplay. The one game I would choose if I had to play it for all eternity.'),
    (131,'Not Recommended','As is usually the case with AI, it cheats, but this at a level that''s unbelievable.'),

    (132,'Recommended','pretty good'),
    (132,'Not Recommended','Beyond the Sword includes all the features of Warlord except the scenarios so I would recommend it as a better CIV VI experiance. I enjoyed the Final Frontier scenario. The other scenarios are ok, but Afterworld is garbage.'),
    (132,'Recommended','best civ 10/10'),
    (132,'Not Recommended','Not worth your time or money'),

    (133,'Recommended','I enjoy city builders, and I enjoy Civilization, so this one was very exciting for me.'),
    (133,'Not Recommended','It''s just a shame that this version has a recurring BUG that totally ruins your cities sometimes for no discernible reasons.'),
    (133,'Recommended','Amazing game, just great at scratching that little nostalgia itch. The graphics haven''t aged too well, but the gameplay mechanics are superb and the game has a lot of soul'),
    (133,'Not Recommended','Fun game with a big bug'),

    (134,'Recommended','Took me about twenty years to master the "monarch" difficulty setting. I hope for twenty more years of fun.'),

    (134,'Recommended','Three words: Best Game Ever.'),
    (134,'Not Recommended','not worth playing today'),

    (135,'Recommended','Harder and stranger, but yet nice, version of original XCom'),
    (135,'Not Recommended','A great game, but as a sequel it does the bare minimum.'),
    (135,'Recommended','oldie but a goodie'),

    (136,'Recommended','Fun game, still holds up in 2022.'),
    (136,'Not Recommended','I think XCOM is just "fine." Its not nearly as complex, ''interfaced-challenged'' or as ridiculously unfair as the original DOS classic, but by no means does that make it superior in any way,'),
    (136,'Recommended','old but gold, still a great game today 11.12.2022. This is a game that keeps giving you new content as you play. Highly recommend this and Xcom 2'),
    (136,'Not Recommended','this game fails to play as described. a vital aspect of the game does not work. engineers do not manufacture items when so directed'),

    (137,'Recommended','👍'),
    (137,'Not Recommended','Whoever thought it was an okay idea to have the Steam version of XCOM 2 launch into the 2k launcher for this game is dumb'),
    (137,'Recommended','10/10 Love Hate Relationship'),
    (137,'Not Recommended','Stupid 2K Launchers wont let me play the game. I miss XCOM2.'),

    (138,'Recommended','A fun way to re-watch the series with small-added details and climactic experience as characters yourself. Though I would say the combos could have been worked better ''cause there''s a mild delay between attacks and super attack combination.'),
    (138,'Not Recommended','Honestly WAY better then I thought it would be. '),
    (138,'Recommended','Great gameplay and story line'),
    (138,'Not Recommended','This game is not an RPG. It''s more like a 3D hack and slash that progresses you through the story of Dragon Ball Z. A significant downgrade from a game like Xenoverse 2.'),

    (139,'Recommended','One of my favourite games'),
    (139,'Not Recommended','Why is it so expensive'),
    (139,'Recommended','Even tho is expensive I enjoy the game'),
    (139,'Not Recommended','not worth it'),

    (141,'Recommended','Not a fan of the dragon ball series but this was a fun weeaboo simulator with my bf and his friend.'),
    (141,'Not Recommended','i don''t recommend buying it if you have Xenoverse 2 because this last game it''s the same game but with more content (DLC) and more graphic.'),
    (141,'Recommended','This is a awesome game. trying to 100% is a challenge with rng but its a fun challenge. would recommend if your looking for a fighting/mmo game'),
    (141,'Not Recommended','Look, you''re better off buying the sequel which not only has this game within it, but much more to offer. I''m literally only playing it now because I paid money for this game a literal week before they announced XV2. '),

    (142,'Recommended','The rare matches that have a well coordinated team are a lot of fun.'),
    (142,'Not Recommended','The Breakers suffers from a starry-eyed gameplay vision that, in execution, likely just wasn''t as good as it sounded on paper. I think we all fell for that, really-- Including the developers.'),
    (142,'Recommended','I really enjoy this game as a lifelong fan of Dragon Ball Z and related medias as well as asymmetrical games like Dead By Daylight'),
    (142,'Not Recommended','It had so much potential. It could have been great. But its not.'),

    (143,'Recommended','Somewhat of a black sheep in the Souls series, but probably worth your time if you enjoy the other ones.'),
    (143,'Not Recommended','I want to like this version, but I wholeheartedly believe the original is better.'),
    (143,'Recommended','It really was better than Dark Souls 1.'),
    (143,'Not Recommended','Don''t get this game on pc. The controls will ruin your fun.'),

    (144,'Recommended','Best game ever.'),
    (144,'Not Recommended','For the love of god, please put your games on sale!!'),
    (144,'Recommended','Its Dark Souls. A hardcore masterpiece, enough said.'),
    (144,'Not Recommended','Game''s absolute rubbish, I hate it'),

    (145,'Recommended','This game will give you an immense amount of satisfaction along with deep suffering. Sadly, after playing any soulsborne game, all the bosses in other games tend to appear much lamer.'),
    (145,'Not Recommended','I really want to play this game, but can''t because it either crashes when I''m loading in or crashes randomly when I''m playing. I''m able to run this game perfectly at 60fps on medium, but even on low settings it crashes randomly.'),
    (145,'Recommended','Better than elden ring FOR SURE'),
    (145,'Not Recommended','Great game, but no ultrawide support. By trying to fix it you can get ban... It''s just a shame.'),

    (146,'Recommended','This is the best game. It has ruined every other game for me.'),
    (146,'Not Recommended','It isn’t just too hard - it’s too demoralizing!'),
    (146,'Recommended','I wish it was longer!!!'),
    (146,'Not Recommended','Title is a lie. My shadows keep dying constantly.'),

    (147,'Recommended','Elden Ring breathed a whole new life into the Souls formula. Not only has it brought back past Souls enjoyers, but it''s also touched the hearts of new and unfamiliar players; both of whom have praised this beautiful masterpiece.'),
    (147,'Not Recommended','Seriously. It''s obviously a well-made, high quality game, But MAN, does it have some issues.'),
    (147,'Not Recommended','high end pc, game just constantly lags and drops frames.... not impressed'),

    (148,'Recommended','such a fun game and the hacking part of the game is awsome'),
    (148,'Not Recommended','Great game but it has problems on PC'),
    (148,'Recommended','Great game <3'),
    (148,'Not Recommended','I BOUGHT IT WHY NOT ALLOW ME TO PLAY???'),

    (149,'Recommended','It''s fun to hack everyone and everything in open-world San Francisco. The plot is overall good. Sadly, this is a ubisoft game and you will have to fight with their launcher.'),
    (149,'Not Recommended','This game is full of Hackers!!!'),

    (151,'Recommended','Seriously send help, I play this game even in my dreams'),
    (151,'Recommended','Good stuff.'),

    (152,'Recommended','For me, it''s not anywhere near as fun as the first game. It''s not a bad game. It''s just in it''s predecessor''s shadow.'),
    (152,'Not Recommended','Full disclosure, I enjoyed this game well enough. I do not, however, think it deserves a recommendation. I adored the first game, and hoped to explore more of the world I loved.'),
    (152,'Recommended','not as good as subnautica but still very good :D'),

    (153,'Recommended','IMO the story is waaay better than both the GOTG movies. You feel like you''re in a full fledged Marvel movie while playing!'),
    (153,'Not Recommended','Non-combat gameplay/exploration is on rails, platforming/jumping often feels like you''re stuck in mud'),
    (153,'Recommended','The Gardeners of the Galaxy Rick Rolled me. Highly recommend.'),
    (153,'Not Recommended','Game froze up on me several times requiring force-closing the app + reload from the last checkpoint'),

    (154,'Recommended','8/10'),
    (154,'Recommended','It has great graphics for its cost. You get the DLCS which makes last and just swinging around is great.'),

    (155,'Recommended','Carries over the great traversal and combat mechanics from the first game'),
    (155,'Not Recommended','- Too short to be worth the price; has only around 1/3 the content of the first game'),
    (155,'Recommended','If you liked Spider-Man Remastered, this is more of the same. The game is well worth it if you''re trying to 100% it, however, if you''re a main-story player, maybe wait for a sale!'),
    (155,'Not Recommended','Just a DLC for the first game. It''s not worth 50€, more like 15-20€. Do not get the game for the full price, trust me. I was really confused as the message '"This is the last mission"' came.'),

    (157,'Recommended','An long satisfying romp through beautiful zombie infested Oregon. Tons of side content and a nice long story mode to keep you busy.'),
    (157,'Not Recommended','Overall alright gameplay loop, godawful main mission design, rudimentary game mechanics, extremely unimaginative and predictable story.'),
    (157,'Not Recommended','Mediocrity at its finest. Players should expect more from their games.'),

    (160,'Recommended','Great story telling.'),
    (160,'Not Recommended','Says it has native Steam Controller support, yet the very first interaction (slide up on right touchpad) doesn''t work. I had to rebind controls left <--> right touchpad.'),
    (160,'Not Recommended','I will forever be salty about that plot twist and how much of a plot hole it is.'),

    (161,'Recommended','Good story-adventure game. Much more emotionally portrayed than Heavy Rain'),
    (161,'Not Recommended','Horrible controls.'),
    (161,'Recommended','Very good and interesting story.. 10/10'),

    (162,'Recommended','For any Rick and Morty fan its a must play, genuinely such an enjoyable experience'),
    (162,'Not Recommended','Unless you really like rick and morty, this one is not for you.'),
    (162,'Recommended','pure fun!!'),

    (163,'Recommended','Hilarious. If you like Justin''s TV shows, you''ll love this'),
    (163,'Not Recommended','It''s just too short. There is a lot of humor in the game, and I about died when you get to visit Empty Peepers (seriously one of the funniest bits in the game...)'),
    (163,'Recommended','this is a funny game, but that is expected 11/10'),
    (163,'Not Recommended','Game does not launch on 13th gen Intel.');
